## Process ##

The challenge text _"This challenge is too inverted for me!"_ makes it fairly straightforward. 
Inverting the image is definitely a thing to try. Since my machine doesn't have Photoshop, I used 
[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) that some friends happened to share on Discord a few hours before
I started working on the CTF. Then uploading that new image to a 
[Online barcode reader](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/).

A decent way to start off the CTF. :)

## Toolkit ##

- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
- [Online barcode reader](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/)

## TL:DR ##
- Invert image
- Scan barcode
- Get flag
