## Process ##

This challenge should also be known as "How to google the entire Internet". I spent HOURS looking at all major social 
media sites, looking for relevant accounts and names and using different account finding sites that were filled with LIES.
Eventually I stumbled upon [NameCheckup](https://namecheckup.com/) which listed a blogspot account that took me to the 
blog with the flag.

## TL:DR ##
- Google for hours
- Stumble upon the blogspot link on NameCheckup
- Get flag
