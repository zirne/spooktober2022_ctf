# Spooktober CTF #

## Intro ##

It's that time of the year again! Very little sleep, junk food and Powerking all around. I've been looking forward to 
this CTF since it was announced and even though there was a LOT of cursing (you made me install NodeJS, ugh) I'd do it 
all again. It felt like the challenges were quite a bit harder than last year, and still a lot of fun! Thanks to all 
involved in organizing this. <3

## About ##

Every Challenge has it's own directory with a readme in it. If you don't want to read the ramblings of a crazy person 
trying to remember how he cracked something three days ago, there's a TL:DR at the bottom.
