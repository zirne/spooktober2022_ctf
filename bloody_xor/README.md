# Bloody XOR #

## Process ##

Well. The obvious question is "XOR with what?". I spent a while trying to figure out something interesting, and tried a 
couple of tools that claimed to "Break XOR" but didn't do a good job. Then I found 
[this link](https://www.codementor.io/@arpitbhayani/deciphering-single-byte-xor-ciphertext-17mtwlzh30). Python snippets? 
My favorite! It even explains how to use it (good docstrings are always welcome)!

Paste it into PyCharm, create a loop over all possible iterations, break when spooky is found. Gottem.

## TL:DR ##
- Get frustrated
- Google stuff
- loot code
- add some crude code
- run it
- Get flag
